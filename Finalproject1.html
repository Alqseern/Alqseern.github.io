            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 6 (cont): Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <p>
            For my final project, I am planning on making a self watering planter! The picture below shows my current idea of how it will look. My motivation behind this is 
            that I suck at watering my plants which leads to them dying. Hopefully, This would be able to help me with keeping my plants alive. A breakdown of the tasks is as follows:
            ⁎ Getting Important Measurements
            ⁎ CAD Modelling 
            ⁎ Printing 
            ⁎ Mold Making And Casting The Base
            ⁎ Assembling
            ⁎ Move The Plant Into Its New Home
            
            The base could also be 3D printed if there are any issues with the plaster and casting process. 
            
            Materials:
            
            ⁑ PLA Filament (already owned)
            ⁑ Plaster (already owned)
            ⁑ OOMOO 30 (already owned)
            ⁑ Cotton rope (ordered)
