            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 6 (cont): Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <p>
            For my final project, I am planning on making a self watering planter! The picture below shows my current idea of how it will look. My motivation behind this is 
            that I suck at watering my plants which leads to them dying. Hopefully, This would be able to help me with keeping my plants alive. A breakdown of the tasks is as follows:
            <ul>
            <li> Getting Important Measurements </li> 
                <li>CAD Modelling </li>
           <li>Printing </li>
            <li> Mold Making And Casting The Base </li> 
            <li> Assembling </li>
            <li> Move The Plant Into Its New Home</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            The base could also be 3D printed if there are any issues with the plaster and casting process. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Materials:
            <ul>
           <li> PLA Filament (already owned)</li>
           <li>Plaster (already owned)</li>
            <li> OOMOO 30 (already owned)</li>
          <li> Cotton rope (ordered) </li>
             </ul>
            
            
            
              
              

            </p>
