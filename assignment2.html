            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 2: Getting started with 3D printing!</h1>
            <p>
            In this assignment I assembled my Creality Ender-3 Pro printer and printed some 3D models to test the accuracy of the printer and my calibration of the printer. 
            For the assembly process I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibsOYzXduYc"> this video</a> to assmeble the printer and then used
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EfWVUJjBdA"> this video</a> to level the bed properly. Reflecting on the assembly process, leveling the bed was by
            the most tedious step and I had to try multiple test prints to see if my bed was properly leveled or not and adjust. this process was annoying
             because of the horrible positioning of the knobs at the bottom of the bed. anyways, I needed to get this out of my system back to the assignment!
