            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 3: Getting started with Grasshopper!!</h1>
            <p>
            I used grasshopper and rhino to make a 3D model of a cardboard clip and a nested hexagon geometry. The shape I used for my clip was a circle with slots in it. 
              I determined the width of the slot by measuring the cardboard I was working with which was around 2 mm. I originally designed my slots to be 2 mm but that led
              to the cardboard sliding off. I went by to grasshopper and adjusted the widith of the slot to 1.75 mm in order to see my limits.
              However, 1.75 ended up giving me a good width that fit the slot. Then another issue came up as my circle felt too small and would move and easily slip with enough movement.
              I increased the radius of my circle to 20 mm and that ended up giving great results.

            Next part of the assignment was about making nested geometry using grasshopper and rhino. I used a hexagon for my geometry because I honestly was not sure how 
              it was going to turn out so a safe geometry felt like the move to make. I created the geometry in grasshopper and then connected it using a line extrude in rhino.
