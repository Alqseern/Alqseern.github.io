            My name is Naser Alqseer! I'm an ME masters student and excited to learn the following things in this class: Gain more experience in digital fabrication and learn how to use illustrator. I have some background in 3D model making using softwares such as SolidWorks and NX and I am excited to help my peers in applying that knowledge.
