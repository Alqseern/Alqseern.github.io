            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 4: A4: Getting Meshy! and Lamps!</h1>
            <p>
            For the first part of the assignment, I used two stl files from thingaverse:  <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:95504"> guy Manuel's helmet from daft punk </a>
              and placed it on top of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3481388"> Swashbuckler D&D figure </a>. I ruthlessly used MeshBooleanDifference along with a surface to cut 
              the figure's head and placed Manuel's helmet in its place and then used MeshBooleanUnion to connect the two. I did have to reduce the meshes to 6000 polygons to make it easier to work with.
              I also had to scale the helmet to fit on the figure's head.

            Next part of the assignment was about starting my Lamp design Idea for next week. I was not sure how I wanted to tackle this problem so I looked around for inspiration whether it was from the lecture slides or through google searches
              and I liked about the lamps that I saw was that they all had patterns through out their design. So after measuring the diameter of innereds which 37mm I created the base of my lamp to be 36 mm so I can use 
              the PLA's flexibility along with the geometry I used to hold it. The main issue I faced was getting the pattern to look presentable because it would rely on the number of shapes 
              I used in the rectangular array. This was exteremly time consuming because I refused to use grasshopper for pride reasons and reflecting on this I was being a dumb baby. For my shape I experimented with a couple 
              of shapes such as a star and an ellipse but ended up on a hexagon for personal preference. to get the pattern on the lamp I used flow along surface command in Rhino. 
              I have not started printing the lamp but I generated the gcode for it using cura and it is looking like its going to take 5 hours to print
