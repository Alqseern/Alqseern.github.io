            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 5: Lamps part 2! And molding and casting part 1!</h1>
            <p>
            The first part of the assignmnet printing my design for my lamp which was changing alot because of issues with my printer bed and I tried to compensate for that issue
              in the design of my lamp which messed up alot of the dimensions. Moreover, I went for a design that repeated a patteren for the lamp "head" the before mentioned issues
              caused this process to exteremly tedious. I went for a hexagon repeating patteren along a cylinder. this repeating patteren would fit in a slot in the base of the lamp. 
              there is another hole in base that would fit the innereds of the lamp and be able to hold the bulb. this was a decent idea but failed incredibly in execution because
              some of the hexagons columns would break off and break the structure or I would end up with having to stop the print and start over. The base printed fine and was pretty
              much the only good outcome of this project. The slot in the bottom to hold the wire fit perfect, the innereds were sung in the pocket I created for it.

           the next part of the assignmnet, i decided to go as simple as possible learning from my lamp experiement. I went with a pyramid shape and created the mold in the picture below. 
              I still need to create aligning geometry between the two molds
