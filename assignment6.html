            <h1>Naser Alqseer's Assignment 6:  molding and casting part 2</h1>
            <p>
            First off, I decided to use my D4 dice to get a measuremnt for my pyramid shown in the picture below and with the help of Junchao I was able to create the molds for the molds.
              I printed the two parts and then proceeded to the mold making processThen, I went to the store to get clear plastic cups and popsicle sticks, 
              I used the cups to make sure that the two parts are equal volume and then combined the two and mixed throughly. I poured the mixture into the mold of the mold
              and waited overn night for it to set. In the morning, I used pliers to partially destroy the mold in case I needed to use it again (thankfully, I didn't).
              I mixed the plaster in the cups untill I got a pancake batter thickness and poured it in the mold and waited over night for it to cure. repeated the process for 4 times.
